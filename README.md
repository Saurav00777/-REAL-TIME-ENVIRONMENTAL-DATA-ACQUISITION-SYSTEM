This project involved designing a system using UART, SPI, I2C (including RTC), and other protocols to measure and display real-time temperature and light intensity values. Implemented on real microcontrollers (LPC2129 and 8051), the system provided hands-on experience in interfacing sensors, collecting data, and transmitting it to a PC via UART for real-time monitoring. The RTC was interfaced using I2C to keep accurate time. The embedded C code for the microcontrollers was developed using Keil uVision.
